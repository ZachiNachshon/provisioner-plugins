**Provisioner plugins** are the pluggable extensions for **Provisioner CLI**. 

Every plugin is installed as a pip package. During Provisioner CLI runtime, the commands of any pip installed plugin are dynamically loaded into Provisioner's CLI main menu.

Plugins are using the Provisioner CLI as the runtime and also as the development framework i.e. package dependency.

| :heavy_exclamation_mark: WARNING |
| :--------------------------------------- |
| Provisioner plugins are still in **alpha stage**, breaking changes might occur. |

<h2 id="requirements">üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è Requirements</h2>

- A Unix-like operating system: macOS, Linux
- Python `v3.10` and above
- [Provisioner CLI](https://github.com/ZachiNachshon/provisioner) installed and ready to use

<br>

<h2 id="quickstart">‚ö°Ô∏è QuickStart</h2>

Installing Provisioner plugins is as simple as installing a pip package:

```bash
pip install <plugin-name>
```

<h3 id="how-create-plugin">üî® How to create a <code>Provisioner</code> plugin?</h3>

1. Duplicate the `provisioner_examples_plugin` plugin folder with your plugin name

1. Search for `examples` keyword under your new plugin folder scope and replace where necessary

1. Update the plugin `<my-plugin>/Makefile` build command

1. Append the newly added plugin commands to the `provisioner_examples_plugin` repository outer `Makefile`

1. Define plugin configuration under `<my-plugin>/domain/config.py`

1. Manage plugin version under `<my-plugin>/pyproject.toml` under `[tool.poetry]`

1. Create a Python plugin entrypoint at `<my-plugin>/main.py`

| ‚ùï INFO |
| :--------------------------------------- |
| A `provisioner plugin genereate` command will get added soon to simplify a new plugin scaffolding. |

<br>

<h3 id="playground">üê≥ Playground</h3>

Using `provisioner`, **every** command is a playground.

Use the `--dry-run` (short: `-d`) to check command execution breakdown, you can also add the `--verbose` (short: `-v`) flag to read `DEBUG` information. 

*All dry-run actions are no-op, you can safely run them as they only print to stdout.*
